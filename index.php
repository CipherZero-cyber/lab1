      <p>Hi, I'm Miguel Flores from BSIT-MI184 and I'm from Malibay, Pasay City. I don't belong to the block of MI181 because I started my schooling here in Asia Pacific College 2nd term of SY 2018-2019 due to family and financial reasons. If I were to describe myself, I'm goal-oriented, Family-Oriented friendly, happy-go-lucky, passionate about the things that I do and the things that I like and an open-minded individual. I'm also quite a procrastinator and I tend to be a "yes" person wherein I'm shy in saying "no" to the things assigned to me or to invites of people who are close to me. I like reading books, I love playing badminton, I like to discover new learnings especially in the field of Computers and coding, Culinary and Literature. 
	  Before studying here in Asia Pacific College, I worked as a Customer Service Representative in Concentrix (Before it was called "Convergys) due to financial reasons and to help also my family financially. I faced numerous challenges while working such as the toxic environment of the workplace, ongoing along with some of the employees and their invitations to temptations such as Smoking during breaks and Drinking every salary day and in dealing with the customer in my assigned account which was PLDT and eventually an international/seasonal account. I was given a chance by my father to study, I resigned from my work in a time in which I formed relationships with my co-workers and I was performing well in my Job and I was on track in getting a promotion but I said to myself that having a Bachelor’s Degree in the field that I want is more important than having success in a Job that I was forced into and that I didn't like or love to do. So, I grabbed the opportunity to study here in APC as an IT Student.
Being an Irregular Student, I didn't have a hard time in fitting in with different courses and blocks due to me being friendly and accommodating when they need my help in tasks or assignments for a certain subject. I joined CINEMASoMA and was made an officer due to my passion in watching English Films and recently I was elected as the SOAR Secretary for SY 2019-2020. 
I like travelling to other countries and last summer, my family visited my relatives for the 9th or 10th time in Switzerland. and I'm planning on travelling to Switzerland again this December on my own to attend the wedding of my Cousin.
